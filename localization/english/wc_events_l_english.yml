 WCDRN.2.title:0 "Crash Landing of the Exodar"
 WCDRN.2.desc:0 "In the far reaches of the west, a falling star has crashed upon the relatively peaceful island of Azuremyst. Several pieces and chunks of crystal from the celestial body have scattered across the island chain, contaminating the local ecosystem. We have learned that this crashed object is no simple meteoric rock, but rather a dimensional ship carrying a host of humanoids departed from the shattered world of Draenor, the birthplace of the Horde. These people call themselves the draenei, a race of Light-wielding priests, mages and artificers. They eerily resemble the demonic eredar, who once invaded this world among the Legion's forces. They have crash landed here on Azeroth in an attempt to escape the Legion's onslaught with the help of a being apparently made of pure light, O'ros. Even now, the draenei work to craft a new home for themselves here on Azeroth, centered around the crashed dimensional ship, to which they refer to as the Exodar."
 WCDRN.2.a:0 "May the Light guide them!"
 WCDRN.2.b:0 "They can run, but they can not hide!"
 WCDRN.2.c:0 "As if we hadn't enough trouble with those curs back on Draenor."
 WCDRN.2.d:0 "This is an unexpected turn of events."
