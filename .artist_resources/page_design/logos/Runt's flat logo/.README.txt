Hello it's Runtd and if you're reading this it's probably beacause you want to use the Logo !
Here's my recommendations on which one you should use for what purpose :

- White_Logo.png is the base logo, I suggest using it when it's gonna be big so you can read the text.

- White_logo_horizontal.png and White_logo_vertical.png were made to be used as watermarks,
  you can use them for smaller logos too as the text is easier to read.

- White_logo_notext.png can be used when any text is unreadable. For example, profile pictures.

You can obviously switch to the black versions if you're on a light background.
